# Update

To update all mods, run

```
./packwiz update --all
```


If there's a major or minor version change in Journeymap, rename its config folder to match new version. For example:
```
mv journeymap/config/5.10 journeymap/config/5.11
```

If there's a version change in Complementary Shaders, rename its config files to match new version. For example:
```
mv shaderpacks/ComplementaryReimagined_r5.2.2.zip.txt shaderpacks/ComplementaryReimagined_r5.2.3.zip.txt
mv shaderpacks/ComplementaryUnbound_r5.2.2.zip.txt shaderpacks/ComplementaryUnbound_r5.2.3.zip.txt
```
